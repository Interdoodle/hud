# Interdoodle HUD

Display real-time statistics about the active project build.

Wraps the inspected app with an isolated, minimal interface, showing:

- Resource Utilization
- Users, Quanity and IDs
- Bugs, link to tracker
- Build, link to Release Notes
- Uptime, and time since last deploy
- App-specific Metrics, counters, timers

Reload the app when new component builds require it.  Attempt to preserve state if possible.

Allow state to be persisted, e.g. to append to an issue description.
